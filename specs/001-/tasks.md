# Tasks: 简约个人网站

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Basic component tests included in setup phase. No extensive testing requested in feature spec.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- Paths shown below follow the project structure defined in plan.md

<!--
  ============================================================================
  IMPORTANT: Tasks below are organized by user story for independent implementation.
  Each user story represents a complete, independently testable increment.
  ============================================================================
-->

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-5)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P1 → P2)
- **Polish (Phase 6)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1 but should be independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2 but should be independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Types before data structures
- Data structures before composables
- Composables before components
- Components before integration
- Integration before polish
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All data structure tasks for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members
- All Polish phase tasks marked [P] can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all data structure tasks for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create personal data structure in src/data/personal.ts"
Task: "Create skills data structure in src/data/skills.ts"
Task: "Create experience data structure in src/data/experience.ts"

# Launch all type definition tasks for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create PersonalInfo interface in src/types/personal.ts"
Task: "Create Skill interface in src/types/skill.ts"
Task: "Create Experience interface in src/types/experience.ts"

# Launch all component integration tasks for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Integrate SkillsList component into main page"
Task: "Integrate Timeline component into main page"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1
   - Developer B: User Story 2
   - Developer C: User Story 3
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Focus on simplicity and performance (3-second load time target)
- Maintain strict TypeScript configuration throughout
- Follow Vue3 + Composition API best practices
- Ensure responsive design works across all devices
- Keep design simple with 2-3 color scheme maximum
- All tasks include specific file paths for immediate execution
- Test each user story independently before integration
